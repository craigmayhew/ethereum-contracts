# Ethereum Maths Bounty Contracts

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/craigmayhew/ethereum-contracts.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/craigmayhew/ethereum-contracts)


An experiment in rewarding mathematical progress.

Anyone can send funds to the contracts, and when solutions are found, the contract pays out the prize to the first successful entry.

## The 33 problem

**(UPDATE: 33 IS SOLVED as of March 2019)**

Best explained by numberphile (completely unaffiliated with me, this project or bigprimes.net): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wymmCdLdPvM

Very simply, the formula `33 = a³+b³+c³` has no known solutions. If you find one, sending the correct a, b and c values to the "33" ethereum contract (address to be added here soon) will pay out the value of the contract to you.
